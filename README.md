# GeoGolf
GeoGolf is a Firebase-Enabled Flutter app that is meant to replicate the popular web game [GeoGuesser](https://www.geoguessr.com/).
Users are dropped in a random location that has Google Street View and are tasked with finding where in
the world they are. Users have 5 attempts to place a pin down on Google Maps to try and get as close to
the actual location as they can. Your score is based on how close the pin is to the actual location.
